# rester-livre

A project with training data, in which I was supposed to analyze Ecommerce Data. The goal is to realize a complete analyze with Descriptive Statistics. I realized some univariate and bivariate analysis, and I plotted them with matplotlib.

## Some explanations about the code

I included three classes :

One for data vizualisation
One for univariate analysis
One for bivariate analysis

I created a package with those classes, but to make this project easier to understand, I let the classes in the Jupyter Notebook.
